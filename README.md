# UC Berkeley Math 54, Spring 2020

This is a repository for the course [Math 54: Linear Algebra & Differential Equations](https://math.berkeley.edu/courses/spring-2020-math-54-001-lec) in Spring 2020.

This repository contains most of the information you need for this course (lecture notes, assignments). Course sensitive information (exam, grade distribution etc) will be posted on [bCourses](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1488929) (CalNet ID required).

## General information

Please read the [**Course Policy**](others/CoursePolicy.pdf) **VERY CAREFULLY**  

Instructor: Lin Lin. https://math.berkeley.edu/~linlin/

Lecture: On zoom https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/460774672  MoWeFr 02:10PM - 02:59PM

Office Hours: Mo 12:40PM-2:00PM https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/460774672



**Textbook:** *Linear algebra and differential equations, custom edition for UC Berkeley*.  **ISBN:** 9781323720868

![textbook_1](lectures/assets/textbook_1.png)

This consists of selected chapters from the two books *Linear algebra and its applications, 5th edition* by David C. Lay, and *Fundamentals of differential equations, 9th edition* by R. Kent Nagle, Edward B. Saff and Arthur David Snider. It is fine to use the latter two books instead of the custom edition.

Previous versions of the custom edition, or the separate textbooks as above **may work, but it is your responsibility to make sure that you are doing the correct problem sets for your homework.**
